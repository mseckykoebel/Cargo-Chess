# Cargo chess

## Ideas

- There should be a board class, a space class, and a piece class
- There should be a structure that keeps track of every single board state (time-traveling to other points in the game)
- There should be a way for this to be compatible with a chess UI
- We should have a command that creates a `bash` image of the current board state, as just using the commmand line for this isn't really that great on its own
- Would be cool if we could play against some AI (alpha beta would be easy) at some point down the road
